      p On February 12, 2015 -- a date which will live in infamy, the data by which you live your daily professional lives was suddenly and deliberately <a target="_blank" href="#{image_path('significant_changes.png')}">restricted</a> by the empire of LinkedIn.

      p The developers and companies who leveraged your professional data to improve your lives were at peace with that social network, and at the solicitation of LinkedIn, were still actively utilizing their API looking toward the benefit of a freer, open society of data whereby individual users owned their own data.
